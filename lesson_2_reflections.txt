What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
1. Initial git repository file structure is created. These are needed before commits can be performed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
1. Staging area is a git concept allowing us to chose which files from the working directory to add to the repository.
   A GUI where the user can multiselect files/folders before the commit could probably have done the job better.
